This directory holds unmodified MIDL output from Windows.

Although these are generated files, they are difficult to create in Linux,
so we have put them under source control.

Files are modified with sed and placed in the parent directory.

sed -e 's/EXTERN_C const \(IID\|CLSID\|LIBID\|DIID\) \(IID\|CLSID\|LIBID\|DIID\)_\(..*\);/#define \2_\3 __uuidof(\3)/' raw-MIDL/IBall_idl.h >IBall_idl.h
