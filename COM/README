libcom, by SIL International <http://www.sil.org/>

libcom implements a subset of Microsoft COM.

Version 0.4.0 Development Preview, 2008-03-26

In many ways, libcom functions well. But it isn't necessarily finished yet. This release is a development preview. The examples in the test directory may not build or run properly the way they are currently set up for this release.

When invoking an application that is a COM client, make sure LD_LIBRARY_PATH can find libcom.so, make a components.map file (probably in the directory of the COM server .so file), and set COMPONENTS_MAP_PATH to point to the locations of any components.map files you need to use. 
The test directory contains examples of COM client programs and how to run them.

components.map files are in the format:
01774e93-09f6-4370-847a-a2a697bbadaf ../lib/mylibrary.so
# Comment lines start with hash
Each line tells libcom what so-file can provide an object or interface of a given GUID. After the GUID is a single space, and then after the single space everything is treated as the so-file path until the end of line.

Installation notes:

The build system might inappropriately install these files into PREFIX/lib:
bag.a bag.la bag.so bag.so.0 bag.so.0.0.0 bakery.a bakery.la bakery.so bakery.so.0 bakery.so.0.0.0 ball.a ball.la ball.so ball.so.0 ball.so.0.0.0 wall.a wall.la wall.so wall.so.0 wall.so.0.0.0
They won't hurt anything, but they don't need to be there.
The build system does not yet install header files into PREFIX/include so that applications can use them.
